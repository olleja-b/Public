# üßπ Completely Removing SwitchResX from macOS

**SwitchResX** is a powerful utility for managing custom display resolutions on macOS. However, simply deleting the application does not completely remove its system-level configurations and background services.

I initially installed SwitchResX to resolve a display issue with a 5220x1440 monitor (which turned out to be cable-related). After uninstalling the app, SwitchResX settings continued to appear when reconnecting the monitor ‚Äî indicating leftover configurations.

This script was created to automate the full removal of SwitchResX components.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Download the Script

Open **Terminal**, navigate to the download location, and execute:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop   # or path where you saved the script

‚ö†Ô∏è You may be prompted for your administrator password to remove protected system files.
